# Ona's Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, built using the **Photon** template by HTML5 UP. I customized the design and content to showcase my projects, technical skills, and journey as an IT student.

The website is fully responsive and hosted on Netlify for easy access across devices. This repo includes all source code and assets used to build the site.

A simple (gradient-heavy) single pager that revisits a style I messed with on two
previous designs (Tessellate and Telephasic). Fully responsive, built on Sass,
and, as usual, loaded with an assortment of pre-styled elements. Have fun! :)
